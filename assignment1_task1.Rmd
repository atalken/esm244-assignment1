```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

### Read in the data
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in the data
amphibians <- read_excel(here("data", "sierra_amphibians.xlsx")) %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == "RAMU") %>% #filter to include only mountain yellow-legged frog
  filter(amphibian_life_stage == c("SubAdult", "Tadpole", "Adult")) %>% 
  mutate(year_new = year(survey_date))  %>%  #created new column with only year
  count(year_new, amphibian_life_stage, sort = TRUE) #count number of frogs by year and life stage

```

### Create a graph comparing mountain yellow-legged frog populations by life stage
```{r}
#create ggplot
ggplot(data = amphibians, aes(x = year_new, y = n, color = amphibian_life_stage)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mountain yellow-legged frog population from 1995 to 2002",
       x = "Year",
       y= "Number")
```
