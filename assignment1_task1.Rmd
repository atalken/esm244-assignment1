```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
```

### Read in the data
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in the data
amphibians <- read_excel(here("data", "sierra_amphibians.xlsx"))

amphibian_ls <- amphibians %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == "RAMU") %>% #filter to include only mountain yellow-legged frog
  filter(amphibian_life_stage == c("SubAdult", "Tadpole", "Adult")) %>% 
  mutate(year_new = year(survey_date))  %>%  #created new column with only year
  count(year_new, amphibian_life_stage, sort = TRUE) #count number of frogs by year and life stage

```

### Create a graph comparing mountain yellow-legged frog populations by life stage
```{r}
#create ggplot
ggplot(data = amphibian_ls, aes(x = year_new, y = n, color = amphibian_life_stage)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mountain yellow-legged frog population from 1995 to 2002",
       x = "Year",
       y= "Number")
```

### Create a graph #2

```{r}
amphibian_adults <- amphibians %>% 
  filter(amphibian_life_stage %in% c("SubAdult", "Adult")) %>% #filter to include only Adult and SubAdult frogs
  filter(amphibian_location == "in lake") %>% #only include frogs in the lake
  count(lake_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% #arrange in descending order
  slice(1:5) #only keep top 5 values for n

ggplot(amphibian_adults, aes(x = lake_id, y = n) +
    geom_col()

```
